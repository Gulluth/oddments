# My Catalog

A filterable card catalog built with [Oddments](https://github.com/gulluth/oddments).

## Quick start

### GitHub UI

1. Click **Use this template** → create your repo
2. **In your new repo**, go to **Settings → Pages**, set Source to **GitHub Actions**
3. Edit `oddments.config.js` → set your `title` → commit → site deploys automatically
4. Add exhibits to `oddments/` → commit → site updates automatically

### For local development (optional)

```bash
git clone your-repo
npm install
npm run dev       # preview at http://localhost:5173
```

## Adding content

Each exhibit is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter in `oddments/`.

**Filename format:** `slug.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` if you want to control sort order by publication date.

```yaml
---
name: My Exhibit Title       # required — the only mandatory field
category:                     # recommended — drives tag cloud and filters
  - systems
author: Author Name
source: itch.io               # platform name
source-url: https://example.itch.io/my-exhibit
genre: horror
summary: A one-line description shown on the card.
cost: free                    # free / PWYW / $5.00 / etc.
license: CC BY 4.0
cover-image: https://example.com/cover.png
tags:
  - one-shot
  - investigation
# Optional extended fields
stats: 8 HP, 1 Armor, 10 STR
subtexts:
  - "First bullet point on the entry page."
  - "Second bullet point."
featured: true                # featured exhibits get a highlighted card accent
imageOrientation: portrait    # landscape | portrait | none — overrides global config
published: false              # optional — hide this exhibit without deleting it
---

Optional markdown body rendered on the exhibit page. Delete this if unused.
```

Only `name` is required. Every other field degrades gracefully when absent.

Exhibits are published by default. Add `published: false` to keep a file in
your repo while excluding it from the catalog, search, filters, exhibit pages,
and RSS feed.

## Page sections

Add optional Markdown files in the root of your repository:

```sh
hero.md   # appears above the catalog
body.md   # appears below the catalog
```

Both files support frontmatter:

```md
---
published: false
---

# Hidden for now
```

Missing `published` means the section is published.

### Cover images

External `cover-image` URLs are downloaded automatically to `static/covers/` by `Github Actions` when you open a pull request.

To add a cover image locally, place the file in `static/covers/` and set:

```yaml
cover-image: /covers/filename.(jpg|gif|png|webp)
```

## Exhibits structure

Exhibits can live directly in `oddments/` or in any subdirectory:

```sh
oddments/
  my-adventure.md                   ← flat, no date
  2024-01-02-my-system.md           ← flat, with date prefix for sort order
  zines/
    my-zine.md                      ← in a subdir
```

Exhibits with a `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix sort before undated exhibits (newest date first). Undated exhibits sort after all dated ones.

Subdirectory names have no effect on categories. Categories come only from the `category:` field in each exhibit's frontmatter. Organize subdirectories however makes sense for you, the catalog ignores the folder structure.

## Configuration

Edit `oddments.config.js`. Every option is documented inline. Common settings:

```js
export default {
  title: "My Catalog",
  // description: "",
  // icon: "/icon.svg",      // small custom SVG or PNG shown before the title
  // logo: "/logo.svg",      // custom SVG or PNG that replaces icon + title
  // siteUrl: "https://username.github.io/my-catalog",
  // theme: "vintage",        // cerberus | wintry | vintage | crimson | pine | modern
  // cardLayout: 'masonry',   // masonry (default) | grid
  // exhibitsPerPage: 24,
  // imageOrientation: 'landscape',  // landscape | portrait | none
  // showCost: false,
  // copyright: "(c) 2026 My Catalog",
  // copyrightUrl: "https://example.com/license",
  // instagram: "https://instagram.com/example",
  // itch: "https://example.itch.io",
  // github: "https://github.com/example",
}
```

`cardLayout` controls how cards are arranged on the catalog page:

| Value               | Behavior                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `masonry` (default) | Variable-height cards; gaps collapse. Best for mixed content. |
| `grid`              | Uniform rows; all cards in a row share the same height.       |

`imageOrientation` controls how cover images are displayed on cards and exhibit pages. Set it to match the shape of your cover images:

| Value                 | Card image box | Exhibit page layout      |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| `landscape` (default) | 3:2 (wide)     | Image stacked above text  |
| `portrait`            | 2:3 (tall)     | Image left, text right    |
| `none`                | Hidden         | No image, text full width |

Individual exhibits can override the global setting with `imageOrientation:` in their frontmatter.

## Theming

### Preset themes

Set `theme` in `oddments.config.js`:

| Name       | Character      |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| `cerberus` | Dark, moody    |
| `wintry`   | Cool blues     |
| `vintage`  | Warm, aged     |
| `crimson`  | Red, horror    |
| `pine`     | Earthy greens  |
| `modern`   | Clean, minimal |

The default is `cerberus`. Commit the config change and the site redeploys.

### Custom themes

1. Create a theme CSS file at the [Skeleton UI Theme Generator](https://themes.skeleton.dev/)
2. Save it to `static/my-theme.css`
3. In `oddments.config.js`:

```js
theme: "my-theme",
customCss: "/my-theme.css",
```

### Custom CSS

To tweak styles without replacing the whole theme, point `customCss` at a file in `static/`:

```js
customCss: "/my-styles.css",
```

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in your GitHub repo
2. Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
3. Push to `main` → the workflow builds and deploys automatically

For project sites (`username.github.io/my-catalog`), uncomment `basePath` in `oddments.config.js`:

```js
basePath: '/my-catalog',
```

## Upgrading

### GitHub

Edit `package.json`, bump the version number in `"@gulluth/oddments": "^x.y.z"`, save. The Github Actions run `npm install` which resolves the new version automatically.

### Local

```bash
npm update @gulluth/oddments
```

Then push — GitHub Actions rebuilds with the new version.

## Custom fields

If your catalog needs fields beyond the standard set, declare them in `oddments.config.js`:

```js
customFields: [
  { key: "page_count", label: "Pages",     type: "text", multiple: false },
  { key: "publisher",  label: "Publisher", type: "text", multiple: false },
  { key: "system",     label: "System",    type: "text", multiple: true  },
],
```

Then add the corresponding keys to your exhibit frontmatter. Fields not declared here are ignored.

## Bulk import from CSV

If you have existing data in a spreadsheet, the included `csv_to_oddments.py` script (in the oddments repo) can generate markdown files. See the script header for column format details.
